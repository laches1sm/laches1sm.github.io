        <h1>Talks</h1>
        <p>Throughout my career, I've enjoyed giving several talks to local conferences across Ireland.</p>

            <h2>2018</h2>
            <h3>BelFOSS - OBIG: The Story of Project Lintol </h3>
            <p>As part of my work at <a href="https://github.com/lintol">Project Lintol</a>, I assisted Phil Weir in
                giving a talk about the project, which was a collection of data validators/processors. I talked about my
                contributions to the project which included GeoJSON processors for validating datasets.</p>

            <h3>Northern Ireland Developer Conference - An App for Culture Night: App Development for Events</h3>
            <p>This talk was concerning a personal project I had undertaken for my Software Development MSc, developing
                an unofficial website and application for the Belfast Culture Night. It was written in both the Laravel
                and Ionic frameworks, before being pared down to only the Laravel section.</p>

            <h3>Pycon Ireland - Django APIs, Versioning, And You</h3>
            <p>This talk was about how to effectively implement versioning in a Django API. Included in the talk was an
                explanation of when user requirements mean that the data that an API has to return must change, two
                versions of the API can co-exist without any breaking changes.</p>

            <h3>Flexera Engineering And Support Summit - The Life Changing Magic of Open Source</h3>
            <p>I gave this talk at an internal company conference to help encourage other developers to get involved in
                the open source community and create contributions to open source projects, and how it could help
                further their careers.</p>

            <p>This talk was about a personal project that I had built using Python to detect deranking bots in the
                popular online video game League of Legends, using machine learning libraries in order to spot patterns
                that these bots had in order to detect them.</p>

            <p>This talk was about how malware could be spread via Sims 4 mods, and how it worked to exploit users’
                machines. I also covered the community response to it, including an antivirus. </p>
